**Bipartite graph is a graph that can be coloured using exactly 2 colours such that no two adjacent nodes have same colour.**   

**If a graph has odd length cycle then it's not bipartite graph.**   

**If a graph doesn't have any odd length cycle then it is bipartite graph. Graph without cycle is bipartite.**
