**Time Complexity: O(V+E). The program does a simple BFS Traversal of the graph which is represented using adjacency list. So the time complexity is O(V+E).** 

**Space Complexity: O(V). To store the visited array and queue O(V) space is required.**

**Time and Space Complexity is same as detect cycle using BFS.**
