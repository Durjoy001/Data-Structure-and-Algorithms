#### [Minimum Spanning Tree Explanation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsM8i0jVF1w&list=PLgUwDviBIf0rGEWe64KWas0Nryn7SCRWw&index=19)   

Graph has to be weighted graph.   

**The defination of spanning tree is when we convert a graph into a tree (remove all edges which makes the graph cyclic and also every node has to be connected)
such that it contain exactly N nodes and N-1 edges. And also every node should be reachable from every other node.Then we can call that tree is a spanning tree.**    

For a given graph there can be multiple spanning tree.   

**Among all the spanning tree possible from the graph, the spanning tree which has minimum total weight of edges is minimum spanning tree.**

**Time Complexity : for brute force time complexity is O(V^2) and for efficient solution time complexity is O(V logV)**
