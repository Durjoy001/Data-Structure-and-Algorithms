**Time Complexity : O(V+E) where V is number of vertices in the graph and E is number of edges in the graph.**   
**V is time taken for visiting V vertices and E is for traveling through adjacent nodes overall.**    

**Space Complexity : O(V+E) + O(V) + O(V)**  
**Space for adjacent list, vis array and queue.**
