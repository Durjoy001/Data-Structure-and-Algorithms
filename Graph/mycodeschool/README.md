### [Introduction to graphs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXgEDyodOJU&list=PL2_aWCzGMAwI3W_JlcBbtYTwiQSsOTa6P&index=38)       
A Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of nodes and edges. The nodes are sometimes also referred to as vertices and the edges are lines or arcs that
connect any two nodes in the graph. Tree is a special kind of graph.   
**A Graph consists of a finite set of vertices(or nodes) and set of Edges which connect a pair of nodes.**   
  
**A Graph G is an ordered pair of a set V of vertices (node) and a set E of edges.**   
**G = ( V , E )**    

Edge are two types directed and undirected. Directed edge can be traverse only in the way of direction and Undirected edges can be traverse in both direction.
It is possible for a graph to have both directed and undirected edges.      

A graph with all directed edges
is called a **directed graph** or digraph and a graph with all undirected ages is called an **undirected graph**.   

Directed graph or digraph in which edges are uni-directional or ordered pairs and
undirected graph in which edges are bi-directional or unordered pairs.      

**Also a graph can be weighted or unweighted.**       

**Graphs are used to represent many real-life applications: Graphs are used to represent networks.Graphs are also used in social networks like linkedIn, Facebook.**
