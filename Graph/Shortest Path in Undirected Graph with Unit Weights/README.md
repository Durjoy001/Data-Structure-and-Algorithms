#### [Shortest Path in Undirected Graph with Unit Weights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwCWi7-bRfI&list=PLgUwDviBIf0rGEWe64KWas0Nryn7SCRWw&index=16&t=68s)

If the graph is unweighted and there are no edge weight always assign 1 to those edge weight.   

**Time and Space Copmplexity will be same as BFS.**
