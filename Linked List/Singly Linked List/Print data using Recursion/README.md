**To print elements, for normal traversal of the linked list not for the reverse print,for the normal print an iterative approach will be a lot more efficient than the
recursive approach because in iterative approach we will just use one temporary variable while in recursion we will use space in the stack section of the memory for so many function calls so there is implicit use of memory there.**  

**For ReversePrint operation we will any way have to store elements in some
structure so if we use recursion it's still okay.** 

**so recursion kind of gives us a way to traverse the list in the forward direction and traverse the list in the backward direction**
