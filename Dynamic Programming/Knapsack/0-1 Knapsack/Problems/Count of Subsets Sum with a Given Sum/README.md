**For recursive approach Time complexity is 2^N (because for every element we include this or not include this in answer).**   

**Bottom UP approach Time Complexity:**    
* **Time Complexity: O(sum * n), where sum is the ‘target sum’ and ‘n’ is the size of array.**  
* **Auxiliary Space: O(sum * n), as the size of 2-D array is sum*n.**
