**DP is Enhanced Recursion. Recursion is a parent of DP.**  

How to identify DP problems?   
* **There will be choice (include a particular element in answer or not include this in answer).**   
(**To solve this type of problems there will be need for Recursion approach and if there have overlaping subproblems then there will be need of DP solution, In recursion code if in any condition there need for two recursive function call execute then there will be overlaping subproblems. One function call = NO DP , TWO function call = DP.**)

* **Have to find optimal answer of a problem.Such as minimum,maximum(maximum profit,maximum value etc),largest,smalest.**    

**First solve recursive solution then do Memoization or Bottom-Up DP.**
