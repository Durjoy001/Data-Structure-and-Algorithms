**Expression: [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-an-expression-and-what-are-the-types-of-expressions/?ref=rp)** An expression is a combination of operators, constants and variables. An expression may consist of one or more operands, and zero or more operators to produce a value.   
expresion: a+b ,, a and b is operand and + is operator.    
### [:boom: GeeksforGeeks: Arithmetic Expression Evalution](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/arithmetic-expression-evalution/)  
**Expressions are usually represented in what is known as Infix notation, in which each operator is written between two operands i.e  (A + B).**      
  
**Polish notation (prefix notation) –**  
**It refers to the notation in which the operator is placed before its two operands . Here no parentheses are required, i.e.  +AB**    
  
**Reverse Polish notation(postfix notation) –**  
**It refers to the analogous notation in which the operator is placed after its two operands. Again, no parentheses is required in Reverse Polish notation, i.e. AB+**    

There are 3 levels of operator-precedence for 5 binary operators as given below:    

* **Parentheses:**  () {} []    
* **Highest:**  Exponentiation (^) ( right to left)   
* **Next highest:**  Multiplication (*) and division (/)   ( left to right)  
* **Lowest:**  Addition (+) and Subtraction (-)   ( left to right)
