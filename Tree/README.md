Tree is one data structure that's quite often used to represent hierarchical data.    
**So tree is an efficient way of storing and organizing data that is naturally hierarchical.**   

Tree data structure can be defined as a collection of entities called nodes linked together to 
simulate hierarchy.       

**Tree is a non-linear data structure. It's a hierarchical structure.**        

Each node will contain some data and this can be data of any type. And may contain link or reference to some other nodes that can be called its children.       

The topmost node in the tree is called **root** of the tree. Root would be the only node without a parent.     
Children of same parent are called **sibling**.     
If a node has a direct link to some other node, then we have a **parent child** relationship between the nodes.    
Any node in the tree that does not have a child is called **leaf** node.    

And we can have some more relationships like parent of parent can be called grand-parent.     

**If we can go from node A to node B, then A can be called ancestor of B and B can be called descendant of A.**    

1->2->5->10  ,select node 10     
1, 2 and 5 are all ancestors of 10 and 10 is a descendant of all of these nodes.     

Nodes not having same parent but having same grandparent can be called **cousins**.
